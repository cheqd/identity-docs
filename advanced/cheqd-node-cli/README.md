# ðŸ›° cheqd Cosmos CLI for identity

> **NOTE: The tutorials below are only recommended to be used for testing purposes!**
>
> Using `cheqd-node` Cosmos CLI for real-world production environments is not recommended, since the identity keys are passed in raw form to the CLI. This is fine in development/testing usage, but is not recommend for mainnet.

# Create Verifiable Presentation

## Overview

This tutorial offers step-by-step guidance on how to create a [Verifiable Presentation](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vp-request-spec/).

Creating a Verifiable Presentation can be achieved through both the Veramo CLI, or directly through an application, setup to read and write to the cheqd ledger, using the Veramo SDK for cheqd.

## Pre-requisites

A Verifiable Presentation will always be created by the holder themselves. Therefore this part will use the `did:key` that was created for the subject.

For full information on the architecture, setup and cofig, check [`did-provider-cheqd`](https://github.com/cheqd/did-provider-cheqd).

>Ensure you have saved the [`agent.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheqd/did-provider-cheqd/main/agent.yml) file in your local project directory.

## Steps

### Step 1

Begin creating a Verifiable Presentation with:

```bash
veramo presentation create
```

### Step 2

Specify the subject to be used for the Variable Presentation creation (i.e. chosen holder `did:key`)

### Step 3

Select the issuer DID you would like to use from the issuer DIDs presented.

### Step 5

Specify the Presentation type. This can be the same as the Verifiable Credential or a subpart of it.

### Step 6

Select credential you would like to use to create your Verifiable Presentation. If you have not yet created a credential, use the tutorial for creating a verifiable credential.

### Step 7

Specify whether you would like to add another credential.

A presentation can use claims from multiple presentations.

### Step 8

Youâ€™ll now see your Verifiable Presentation, both in the JSON format and JWT.

Save the Verifiable Presentation JWT.  

### Step 9

Save the JWT as a txt file under the root directory of your project.

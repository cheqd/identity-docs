# ðŸ“¦ Software Development Kits (SDKs)

One of cheqd's primary motives is to make itself accessible to the broadest set of identity applications possible. To accomplish this, it is necessary to build cheqd support into existing Software Development Kits (SDKs).&#x20;

Through these SDKs, it will be made far easier to utilise cheqd's identity functionality.&#x20;

## Supported SDKs

cheqd are constantly expanding the amount of SDKs supported in order to support multiple credential types and protocols.&#x20;

You can take a look at which [specific protocols are covered by which SDKs on our Product site here](https://product.cheqd.io/products/toolbox).

# â™» Charge for Verifiable Credentials

Credential Payments brings a significant evolution to the Verifiable Credentials landscape, allowing **verifiers to directly pay issuers to unlock Credential Status information**. Underneath the hood, we've engineered a robust and secure payment flow that streamlines the end-to-end payment process, with accuracy, speed, and cryptographic integrity.

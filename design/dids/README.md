# ðŸ†” DIDs

## Overview

[Decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers).

If you want to learn more about what DIDs are, [please go over to our learning site here](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/introduction-to-decentralised-identity).

## cheqd DID method

DIDs must be registered in a formal DID method, which lays out a common set of protocols for interacting with the DID, such as creation, updates and deactivation.

Please find our [cheqd DID method architecture decision record here.](https://docs.cheqd.io/node/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-cheqd-did-method).

## W3C DID Test Suite

DID methods, DID resolvers and DID URL dereferencers can be passed through the W3C DID Test Suite to demonstrate whether they comply to a set of commonly understood and accepted criteria.

You can also find the cheqd DID method formally registered in the [W3C DID Spec Registries](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/)

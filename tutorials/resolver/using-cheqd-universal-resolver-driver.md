# Overview

This document is describing how to setup `did-resolver` as a proxy client to redirect local queries to another external server. The main start point here is the did-resolver root directory and `docker` inside.

## Run the docker-compose

We are assuming that environment is setup and docker-compose the latest version is installed. For more information how to setup docker you can go to [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

So, for starting up the docker service with redirecting queries to external resource, you can change the default parameters:

```text
# Local address which is used by user application

LOCAL_REDIRECT_FROM=localhost:80

# Address with port of external Cheqd-DID-Resolver.

EXTERNAL_REDIRECT_TO=http://localhost:1313
```

- `LOCAL_REDIRECT_FROM` - it's the local address on your machine which will be used as an input point for queries
- `EXTERNAL_REDIRECT_TO` - it's the external address of the server which you going to use for redirecting to

For example, for using `https://did-resolver.cheqd.dev/` external resolver, the next string can be used for pointing it `EXTERNAL_REDIRECT_TO=https://did-resolver.cheqd.dev/`

After setting up such 2 parameters all you need is just to run:

```bash
$ docker compose --profile light up
```

The example of outputs:

- from docker-compose service:

```text
did-resolver/docker$ docker compose --profile light up

# Create an off-ledger DID for credential subjects with Veramo CLI

This tutorial offers step-by-step guidance on how to create a subject DID to be used for a holder that will receive a Verifiable Credentials, using the Veramo SDK for cheqd.

We chose to use [`did:key`](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-key) for the holder because the [`did:key`](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/) specification has a lot synergy with cheqd did method, [`did:cheqd`](https://docs.cheqd.io/node/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-cheqd-did-method).

Using [`did:key`](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-key) also keeps holder DIDs off-ledger. This is very important for the privacy and data protection of the holder. If holder DIDs and DIDDocs were stored on-ledger, this could constitute a risk where data written within the DIDDoc could not be removed in line with a holder's right to be forgotten.

It is also easily managable by a client agent as a full ledger backup for the writing of a DID / DID Doc is not required, thereby making it easily reproducable in a client environment.

Creating a subject [`did:key`](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-key) DID can be achieved through both the Veramo CLI, or directly through an application that has been setup to read and write to the cheqd ledger, using the Veramo SDK for cheqd.

## Before you begin

* Make sure you've [done the pre-requisite setup](README.md)

## Creating off-ledger `did:key` DIDs

### 1. Invoke Veramo CLI DID create function

This off-ledger DID, of type `did:key`, is used for the recipient of the Verifiable Credential and Verifiable Presentation using:

```bash
veramo did create
```

### 2. Select the `did:key` provider

Select `did:key`

### 3. Select the Key Management System (KMS)

Select key management system (KMS). The [`agent.yml`](https://github.com/cheqd/did-provider-cheqd/blob/main/agent.yml) file used for the Veramo SDK for cheqd has a preloaded local key management system which is bootstrapped along with the CLI.

This provides a sqlite file which is dumped to your specified root directory.

### 4. Enter an alias for the DID

This is the nickname for your did, which will be managed by the key management system (KMS). Naming this to something more memorable will help when retrieving dids from your KMS.

For example, enter `'John government ID`â€™.

Once you have entered this, you will receive a response in a table, e.g:

| provider                  | alias                  | did |   |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------ |
| did:key     | John government ID  | `did:key:z6MkjxdqDUWoudesywsGYbzGozUeVYiYVArdoqPcMV6m6MG4`                                |

Your `did:key` has now been created.
